# StanceDetector-Academic-Hyland-
Academic Stance Detector (Hyland) is a Tkinter desktop app that extracts thesis sections from text, identifies stance markers using an NLTK pipeline grounded in Hyland’s stance framework, and can optionally validate the resulting CSV with a Gemini-based AI pass. Users can convert PDFs to text, split a thesis into sections via TOC/page mapping.
